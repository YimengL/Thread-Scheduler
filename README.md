All the project descriptions can be find in project_1.pdf

How to Run it:

BASH: sh mymake_cpp.sh

BASH: ./project.out 0 input_1

Description:
Finished nearly all the functions mentioned in the project requirement, but race condition will happen when thread entering readyqueue at integer time(just like input_0). Can't figure it out why that happens.
